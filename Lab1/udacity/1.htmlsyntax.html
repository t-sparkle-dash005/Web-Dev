<h1>The Polar Hunters</h1>
<p><i>The largest bear</i> in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic. The polar bear's Latin name, Ursus maritimus, means <b>"sea bear."</b> It's an apt name for this majestic species, which spends much of its life in, around, or on the oceanâ€“predominantly on the sea ice. In the United States, Alaska is home to two polar bear subpopulations.</p>
<p>The survival and the protection of the polar bear habitat are urgent issues for WWF. In October 2019, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Polar Bear Specialist Group released a new assessment of polar bear populations showing that the number of polar bear subpopulations experience recent declines has increased to four, with eight populations still being data-deficient. <u>The good news is that five populations are stable while two have been experiencing an upward trend</u>.</p>
