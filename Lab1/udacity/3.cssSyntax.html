<h2>How did whales evolve?</h2>

<h3>The first ancestor of a whale</h3>
<p class="pakicetus"><i>Pakicetus</i> (pictured in the corner) looked nothing like a whale, but it would have felt at home in the water. It lived on land, on the edge of lakes and riverbanks in what is now Pakistan and India. It hunted small land animals and freshwater fish, and could even hear underwater.<span class="con">Eventually the relatives of this animal ventured further into the water and evolved to cope with their new environment.</span></p>
<h3>Into the water</h3>
<p >One species of these relatives was called Ambulocetus. It lived in or near estuaries about 50 to 48 million years ago. Like Pakicetus, it spent time both in and out of water, but its large feet looked more like flippers than its ancestor's longer legs. It also used its tail for swimming.</p>
<p>Further along this evolutionary journey we find Dorudon, which lived 40 to 33 million years ago. This five-metre-long animal had proper flippers and tiny hind legs. It lived entirely in the water and was a good swimmer.</p>
<h3>Whales without teeth</h3>

<p id="con2">The descendants of Dorudon went on to evolve into modern whales. About 34 million years ago, a group of whales began to develop a new way of eating. They had flatter skulls and feeding filters in their mouths.
These are called baleen whales, which include blue whales and humpback whales. Others whales keep their teeth - this group includes dolphins, porpoises, orcas and sperm whales.</p>
