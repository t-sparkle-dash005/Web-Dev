        <p>The <em> border collies </em> are awesome because <strong> they are easy to train and love walking outside. </strong> This intelligent breed loves a challenge, so keep them guessing with puzzle toys and plenty of mental stimulation. Border Collies are <em>eager to please and will appreciate as much praise and attention as you can give them.</em>
