        <p>Since it's winter, it's pretty hard to go the mountains by bike, we'll create plan for our journey. <br>
            <ol><li><strong><u>Well, first of all prepare your bike. Make sure everything is ok and check every spare part of your transport.</u></strong></li>
                <li><strong><u> Search up for route that is convenient for you
                </u></strong></li>
                <li><strong><u> Make sure the weather will be clear on the day of bike-trip </u> </strong></li></ol></p>
<p>Now you're ready for incredible journey!</p>

     <p>Each year one hundred boys under the age of eighteen enter into a walking competition where there can only be one winner. Boys around the country enter to compete despite knowing there will be only one survivor. The reward is too high not to be drawn in. The idea that you can have whatever you want for the rest of your life is something they are willing to risk everything for a chance at having. Among this year’s contestants is sixteen-year-old Ray Garraty and he knows just what to do: keep a pace of four miles per hour without stopping for anything or anyone. Three warnings and you’re out – permanently. Reasons why you should read this: <br>
     <ol><li><u> It's easy and fast to read  </u></li>
         <li><u> The book shows how people's behaviour change under different conditions </u></li>
         <li><u> Author perfectly describes atmosphere of competition </u></li>
     </ol>
