    <p> So you got married. <br>
I’m happy for you. <br>
But it’s not only people – <br>
wolves and she-wolves <br>
join their fates, <br>
in order <br>
to avoid loneliness <br>
and provide <br>
lifelong support <br>
to one another. <br>
To marry like everyone does, <br>
and produce a child, <br>
doesn’t require <br>
great intelligence. <br>
The question in all of this, <br>
is how will the face that <br>
now looks you in the mirror <br>
be judged tomorrow? </p>
