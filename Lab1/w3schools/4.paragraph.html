<p>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</p>

<pre>
   I’ll try my hardest not to glaze however this movie is a masterpiece. The animation,
   the score, the easter eggs are all perfection. There is something new you will find 
   every time watch. This movie tells an honestly profound story that really makes you 
   think about different aspects of your life. The dilemmas the characters face in this 
   movie, (while on a much greater scale of course) are something everybody will face in 
   their own life. Spider-Man is quite possibly my favorite fictional character and his 
   relatability is on display here. Often times we don’t know if what we’re doing is right. 
   There are so many themes I took away from this movie, and there is so much to say. But 
   unfortunately I don’t have the words truthfully there isn’t words that can fully describe 
   the experience this movie makes you feel. If you haven’t seen it yet you need to watch this 
   movie. And in the beginning I said this is the greatest comic book movie ever, but honestly
   it may be one of the greatest movies ever. Watching this movie is like watching poetry in 
   motion, but you’re also watching art in motion, and music, and literature, and a representation 
   of life itself.
