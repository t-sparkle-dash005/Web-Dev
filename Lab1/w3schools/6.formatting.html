<h1>Hydrogen vehicle</h1>
<p>A <mark>hydrogen vehicle</mark> is a vehicle that uses <i>hydrogen</i> (H<sub>2</sub>) to move. Hydrogen vehicles include some road vehicles, rail vehicles, space rockets, forklifts, ships and aircraft. Motive power is generated by <ins><b>converting the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy</b></ins>, either by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to power electric motors or, less commonly, by hydrogen internal combustion.</p>

<p>Hydrogen burns cleaner than fuels such as gasoline or methane but is <b>more difficult to store and transport</b> because of the small size of the molecule. As of the 2020s hydrogen light duty vehicles, including passenger cars, have been sold in small numbers due to competition with battery electric vehicles.</p>
