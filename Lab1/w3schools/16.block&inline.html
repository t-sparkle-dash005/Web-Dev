<h3>Cinderella</h3></div>
<p>A story of a <span style="background-color:#fcfe81;">soft-hearted girl</span>, ‘Cinderella’ narrates how she is treated cruelly by her stepsisters and stepmother. Even after being treated awfully, she was <span style="font-weight:bold;">kind and humble</span>. One day, the king threw a ball and invited all the kingdom’s young women. Cinderella helped her sisters prepare for the ball but wasn’t asked to attend it with them. As they left, her <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fairy godmother</span> appeared. She got a beautiful makeover with magic and goes to the ball, but the magic will last only until midnight.</p>

<p>She entered the ball and caught the eyes of the prince, and they danced all night. As the clock turned 12, she left the ball in a hurry. While leaving, one of her <span style="color:#02afed;">glass slippers fell off </span>her foot. The prince found it and decided to marry the person the slipper belonged to. He looked for her in every house and finally reached Cinderella’s place. Though her mother and sisters tried to keep her away from the prince, the slipper fitted perfectly. She married the prince and <span style="border:1px solid yellow;">lived happily ever after.</span></p>
