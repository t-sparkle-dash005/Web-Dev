<h1>How did whales appear?</h1>
<p>The first whales appeared 50 million years ago, well after the extinction of the dinosaurs, but <br> well before the appearance of the first humans. Their ancestor is most likely an ancient <br> artiodactyl, i.e. a four-legged, even-toed hoofed (ungulate) land mammal, adapted for running. Cetaceans thus have a common ancestor with modern-day artiodactyls such as the cow, the pig,<br> the camel, the giraffe and the hippopotamus.</p>
<h2>Why haven't whales fully evolved?</h2>
<p>Whales and dolphins did not evolve gills because they are mammals. This means that the time <br> that elapsed between their earliest ancestors leaving the water to become land animals is much greater than the time elapsed since their ancestors returned to the ocean.</p>
